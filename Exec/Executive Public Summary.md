*Figure 1:The Public Health in Climate Change Evaluation (PHICCE) framework. Three main climate change factors impact public health: vector-borne disease, air pollution, and food insecurity. Each of these factors can be assessed in the context of achieving SDG 13 through the framework by understanding: (1) different governmental programs in terms of their current strategies, multiple partner cooperation, health literacy awareness, research and innovation, and emergency response amidst air pollution; (2) evaluating the implementation, adoption, and reach of the current programs; (3) and understanding their future plans. These factors align with specific SDG 13 targets–noted in the green circles. This content in the PHICCE framework is adopted and based on previous conceptual frameworks.(Glasgow, Vogt and Boles, 1999; Canadian Public Health Association, 2017; United Nations, 2022; World Health Organization, Regional Office For Europe, n.d.)*
