*Figure 1: The Public Health in Climate Change Evaluation (PHICCE) framework. Three main climate change factors impact public health: vector-borne disease, air pollution, and food insecurity. Each of these factors can be assessed in the context of achieving SDG 13 through the framework by understanding: (1) different governmental programs in terms of their current strategies, multiple partner cooperation, health literacy awareness, research and innovation, and emergency response amidst air pollution; (2) evaluating the implementation, adoption, and reach of the current programs; (3) and understanding their future plans. These factors align with specific SDG 13 targets–noted in the green circles. Implementation is the extent to which the policy is enacted on an organization or governmental level; adoption consists of the settings, practices and plans that are in place and conducted to achieve this policy; reach consists of the target population that is influenced by the policy, and maintenance is the longevity of the program. This content in the PHICCE framework is adopted and based on previous conceptual frameworks (Glasgow, Vogt and Boles, 1999; Canadian Public Health Association, 2017; United Nations, 2022; World Health Organization, Regional Office For Europe, n.d.).*
